 I am a Reader (Associate Professor) in Comparative Politics at the [School of Politics and International Relations](http://www.politics.qmul.ac.uk) at [Queen Mary, University of London](http://www.qmul.ac.uk). From September 2022, I am the Deputy Dean for Education (Regulation and Employability) at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. My university profile can be seen [here](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/politics/staff/profiles/sajuriajavier.html).


I obtained my PhD from the Department of Political Science [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk). Prior to joining Queen Mary, I was a lecturer at [Newcastle's University][1] [Department of Politics][2], and I was also associated with [Newcastle's Open Lab][3]. Before that, I was a postdoctoral Research Associate at the [School of Government and Public Policy](http://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/schoolofgovernmentandpublicpolicy/), [University of Strathclyde](http://www.strath.ac.uk/), working as part of the team behind the ESCR funded **Representative Audit of Britain** project. During that time, I was also part of the [Constitution Unit][4] team as a research associate.

My research interests include political behaviour, comparative politics, social media and politics, and political methodology. My current research now focuses on electoral politics, elite politics (candidates and legislators), techniques for latent variable estimation, and political representation.

I usually write columns (in Spanish) in [La Tercera](https://www.latercera.com/autor/javier-sajuria/) and, more importantly, co-host [Bicameral](https://open.spotify.com/show/7eL0L2zmrZA9BoSv2zXdzD). I am also a member of the board of [Espacio Público](www.espaciopublico.cl) and President of the Chilean Political Science Association (ACCP).
