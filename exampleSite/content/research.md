My main research interest lies in the intersection between Political Behaviour, Comparative Politics, and quantitative methods.

My current research agenda includes:

  - Electoral politics, with an emphasis on British and Chilean politics
  - Elite politics: candidates and legislators from a comparative approach
  - Public opinion
  - Latent variable estimation
  - (Not so) big data, data management, visualisation, and automated collection

I am open to any questions about potential PhD supervision, just drop me an email.
